# Skeet-Game

Skeet or Trap Shooting is a game played by hunters where a clay pigeon is ejected from a throwing device and a marksman attempts to shoot them with a shotgun. Sadly, many clay pigeons (also called "targets" or "birds") are lost during the typical game. Though this sport is an Olympic event and played the world over, it is far too dangerous to play in the computer lab. Therefore, we will build a safer version where nothing but pixels are shot.

This program will be written using the same simplified OpenGL libraries
